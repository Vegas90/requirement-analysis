“Requirement Analysis in Software Development.”
This repository is to explain the importsnce of requirement analysis and how critical in the software development cycle.  

# What is Requirement Analysis?

This is mainly where the project team gathers, analyzes and defines the requirements of the softwareproductto be developed.

# “Why is Requirement Analysis Important?”
This are few reasons as to why requirement analysis is important:

1. Scope definition: it defines the scope of the project to avoid scope screep ( gradual expansion of a project's original goals, tasks, or deliverables)
2. Clarity and understanding - helps understand what the stakeholders want the software to do. 
3. Cost and time Estimation: helps to have an accurate estimation of the money to be used and time

# “Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.”
Requirement Gathering - This involves collecting detailed information from stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations. Techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, observations, and document analysis are used to gather a wide range of inputs. These methods help ensure that all relevant requirements are identified early in the project.

Requirement Elicitation - Elicitation focuses on drawing out requirements by engaging stakeholders through brainstorming sessions, focus groups, and prototyping. These interactive techniques encourage open discussion, helping to clarify unclear needs and discover hidden or overlooked requirements.

Requirement Documentation - Once requirements are gathered and elicited, they are documented in clear and structured formats. This includes creating requirement specification documents, writing user stories from the user’s perspective, and developing use case diagrams to show system interactions, ensuring all requirements are well-understood and traceable.

Requirement Analysis and Modeling - This stage involves examining the documented requirements to determine their priority, feasibility, and interdependencies. Modeling tools such as data flow diagrams and entity-relationship diagrams are used to visualize requirements, making them easier to analyze and communicate with stakeholders and the development team.

Requirement Validation - Validation ensures that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs. This is done through reviews, approvals, and setting clear acceptance criteria. Traceability matrices are also developed to track each requirement throughout the development lifecycle, ensuring nothing is missed.

# “Types of Requirements.”

## Functional requirements
This describes what the system should essentially do. Examples are lik user authentication, property search, filtering, user regitration, booking system, payment system/gateways e.t.c.


## Non-functional requirements
This describes the "how"; how it should work. examples are like security,scalability, relability e.t.c.

# “Use Case Diagrams.”
This are diagrams that show how different users interact with the system to achieve speific goals. Some of the benefits include
1. it provides a clear presenatations of the users and their different roles 
2. it helps to see the system functionalities.

# “Acceptance Criteria.”
This are conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by the stakeholders. Helps to have a clearer udnerstanding of the feature requirements and also provide basis for testing ad validation. 

Accpetance criteria for the Checkout feature. 
- Validate that the customer has filled all the fields required to book a place before checking out. 
 - User should be able to see all the details before clicking "checkout".
